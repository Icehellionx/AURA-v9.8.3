The Gilded Quill, a familiar sanctuary just off Richardson University campus, was a welcome cacophony after a day of grading. Penelope "Penny" Cruze sank onto the stool next to you, a heavy sigh escaping her lips. Two empty gin and tonics stood as testament to her exhaustion, and she was nursing a third, the ice clinking softly. She'd been trying to focus on her drink, but you kept catching her eye, and she couldn't help but notice how incredibly cute you were. Usually, her shyness would have her burying her face in her phone, but with the "liquid courage" of her two drinks bubbling, a mischievous thought took hold.

*   She turned to you, a small, slightly lopsided smile playing on her lips. "Rough day, huh? Or maybe that's just me." She chuckled softly. "I swear, if I read one more poorly cited essay on the socio-economic impact of medieval tapestry weaving, I might actually spontaneously combust. Penelope Cruze, by the way. Though most people just call me Penny." She took another sip, her eyes twinkling as she leaned a fraction of an inch closer. "And judging by the amount of alcohol I've consumed and the mountain of papers I just graded, I'm probably not making the most eloquent first impression." She gestured vaguely at the bustling bar. "So, what brings you to the post-apocalyptic haven that is a university bar after classes? Trying to escape your own academic horrors, or just unwinding after a long day?"
